#### Unmanaged Waste: A Hidden Trillion-Dollar Market

The global waste management market, valued at around $1.3 trillion, plays a significant role in the world's economy \[Source 10\](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/how-the-garbage-industry-outperformed-the-market.html). Yet, this market size does not account for all waste generated. Certain types of waste, such as unrecycled plastic and food waste, represent a hidden market that is not currently fully managed.

For instance, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled, leaving a vast majority of it unmanaged \[Source 14\](https://www.oecd.org/environment/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.htm#:~:text=only%209%25%20of%20plastic%20waste%20is%20recycled%20(15%25%20is,is%20disposed%20of%20as%20residues). Notably, 95% of the value of plastic packaging material, worth USD 80-120 billion annually, is lost to the economy \[Source 17\](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/plastics-and-the-circular-economy-deep-dive). This unmanaged plastic waste represents a significant market opportunity.

Furthermore, global food waste, estimated to be worth about $1.2 trillion, is another significant portion of waste not currently managed \[Source 16\](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/global-food-waste-in-2022). This waste represents a missed opportunity for waste management and also contributes to environmental pollution and resource depletion.

Combining these figures, the total waste management market, including both managed and unmanaged waste, could be estimated as follows:

\- The managed waste market: $1.3 trillion

\- The unmanaged plastic waste market: $80-120 billion

\- The unmanaged food waste market: $1.2 trillion

Total potential waste management market = $1.3 trillion (managed waste market) + $0.1 trillion (unmanaged plastic waste market) + $1.2 trillion (unmanaged food waste market)

Total potential waste management market = $2.6 trillion - $2.62 trillion

This equation shows that the total potential waste management market is significantly larger than the current market size of $1.3 trillion.

In conclusion, while the waste management market size is a significant part of the global economy, there are untapped opportunities in managing unrecycled plastic and food waste. These areas represent a hidden trillion-dollar market that, if managed effectively, could contribute to environmental protection, resource recovery, economic growth, and job creation.
